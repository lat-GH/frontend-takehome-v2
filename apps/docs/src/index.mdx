In part one, you'll be tasked to build upon an existing React SPA where you'll hook up a backend API to a Dropdown of departments, which should display a List of sub-departments

### Tasks

1. Using the departments API, create a Dropdown component that renders a list of departments
2. When selecting a department, fetch the sub departments based on the selected department and render them in the List component
3. Make sure tests and types still work.

### Rules

1. You can add any dependencies you want to the project but please do not remove
   the use of React's Context or Reducer methods from the project. We use it heavily here at autone and want to assess your understanding of it.
2. You can use any resources (Google, StackOverflow etc.) you want to complete this test.

Once you have completed the task to your satisfaction, please zip up your
project and send it back to `careers@autone.io`. We'll review your submission...

### What we're looking for

We are looking for a few things in this test:

1. Your ability to write clean, maintainable code
2. Your ability to build upon existing code
3. Your ability to spot the need for refactoring
